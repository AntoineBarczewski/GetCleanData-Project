GetCleanData-Project
====================

This repo is made for submitting my work for the Getting & Cleaning Data class

We will find three files:
* READ.md
* run_analysis.R
* code_book.md

To obtain the tidy data tables you have to run the run_analysis.R once you have unzipped your work on your working directory.

The code book is a description of the variables.

Thank you very much for assessing me !

Antoine
